Main Features:
1. FizzBuzz output will be generated for given valid inputs.
2. Implemented proper validations like: Null Check, Non-Numeric, Non-Decimal Non-Negative.
3. Words "Fizz" and "Buzz" can be replaced by any other words.
4. The Multiple values can be changed other than "3" and "5".
5. Output can be shown on Console in a formatted way.
6. To ensure the code quality, Implemented and Executed the Unit Test cases.

Solution Description:
Solution contains (2) projects.

Project: FizzBuzz
	- It Contains core logic to perform FizzBuzz.
		Class:	FizzBuzzLogic
				- Contains Logic To validate Input and compute fizzbuzz. 
        
        
Project: FizzBuzz.Tests
	- Contains Test methods which can compute the entered values for Multiples of 3 and 5.

Code Implementation Features:
1. Easier to read (Both junior & senior developers will quickly understand what the code does)
2. The least amount of coding invlolved
3. Less code = less likelihood of bugs
4. Less code = easier to troubleshoot if necessary


Enhancements:
1) We can try extending the application such that a user could provide any range of numbers (such as from the console, or from configuration)
2) We can try extending the application to support new rules – output “Baz” for numbers divisible by 4
3) Instead of printing the numbers to the console, we could try extending the app to write to a file
